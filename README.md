# n-body-java

#### Getting Started: ####
1. Clone wherever you like with `git clone https://github.com/iwburns/n-body-java.git`
1. Go get [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)
  * n-body-java is using LWJGL #3.0.0 build 7, so get that one.
  * Update: LWJGL #3.0.0 build 8 has been released and n-body-java seems to work fine with it.
1. Go get [JOML](http://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/)
  * At the time of this writing, JOML has moved to maven.  This project assumes JOML version 1.6.6.
